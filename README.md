For anyone thinking this is actually a Dating (web) App. It is not

It's just a web app that i follow tutorial on some random ass Udemy Course

You must be asking yourself. Why tf do i even study Web again when i already made one ?

The answer is to learn C# you fucking idiot. Most of the code is C# which is use to handle API and back end

Also i will be learning Azure so hope shit don't get so bad. Wish me luck nerd!
